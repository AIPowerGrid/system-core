# alembic - grid database migrations

## Purpose

Migration source for Grid-owned database tables. These migrations must make the
production database match `grid_api/v2/schema.py` without relying on
`create_all(checkfirst=True)` to alter existing tables.

## Ownership

- `env.py` - Alembic environment.
- `script.py.mako` - revision template.
- `versions/` - ordered migration revisions.

## Local Contracts

- Every schema change in `grid_api/v2/schema.py` requires a matching Alembic
  revision, including constraints and indexes.
- Migrations must be idempotent only where Alembic expects them to be; do not
  hide failed DDL with broad exception swallowing.
- Economic constraints matter: unique `grid_ledger.job_id`, non-null credit refs
  for value-moving rows, and FK consistency are money-safety properties.
- Do not edit or depend on generated `__pycache__` files.

## Work Guidance

- Name revisions with the next sequence and a short description.
- Include data backfill or validation steps when tightening nullable columns.
- Keep downgrade honest; if a downgrade is unsafe, state that explicitly in code
  comments.
- After changing migrations, update deploy/runbooks if production upgrade
  commands or order change.

## Verification

- Run migration upgrade/downgrade against a disposable DB when practical.
- At minimum, run `pytest grid_api/services/tests/test_credits_billing.py` for
  credit-ledger or account schema changes.

## Child DOX Index

- None - leaf.
