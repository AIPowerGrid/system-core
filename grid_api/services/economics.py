"""Grid economics — how customer revenue splits, and how workers get paid.

The model (decided 2026-06-23):

* CUSTOMERS pay in USD (USDC primary; ETH/cbBTC swapped to USDC at the door;
  AIPG accepted at the peg, optionally with a bonus). Credits are micro-USD.
* Revenue splits 85 / 3 / 12 — generator (worker) / sentinel / protocol — the
  same split as docs/architecture/ECONOMICS.md. All three are knobs below.
* WORKERS are paid mostly in USDC plus a slice of AIPG (WORKER_AIPG_SHARE_BPS).
  They live off the USDC, so the AIPG isn't rent money they're forced to dump —
  lower sell pressure, long-term alignment. The AIPG slice is valued at payout
  time (market price), so a worker always receives their full den-share value.
* The AIPG slice is SOURCED from (a) AIPG taken in via AIPG-denominated payments
  and a founder/treasury GRANT to the reward pool, then (b) topped up by ON-MARKET
  buybacks with a portion of USDC revenue. The protocol is a net AIPG *buyer*,
  never a seller — it never swaps AIPG→USDC, and never routes protocol revenue to
  a founder wallet in exchange for tokens (that would be founder-dump, not buy
  pressure). Buybacks are TWAP'd + capped per epoch so thin AIPG liquidity can't
  wreck fills; the cap quietly leans payouts USDC-heavy when a buy would move the
  market too far.

Launch posture (safe defaults below): accept USD, pay workers 100% USDC
(WORKER_AIPG_SHARE_BPS=0), AIPG bonus + buyback OFF. Turn the AIPG slice +
buyback on once payout volume exists and AIPG liquidity can absorb it.

Everything is integer micro-USD (USD × 1e6) and basis points (1% = 100 bps), so
splits are exact — no float drift on the money path.
