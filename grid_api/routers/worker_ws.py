"""WebSocket endpoint for grid workers — the unified worker protocol.

One protocol for every worker type. Workers register with the job types they
serve (text | image | video), receive jobs pushed from the per-type Redis
Streams, and report results back:

  text  — stream tokens; relayed to Redis Pub/Sub for SSE clients
  media — upload outputs directly to R2 via presigned PUT URLs included in
          the job message (workers never hold storage credentials), then
          report the object keys + content hashes

Every completion appends an event to the grid_ledger (den + prompt/result
hashes) — the source of truth the on-chain settlement pays against.

Worker registry is stored in Redis (not in-memory) so multiple
uvicorn processes can share state.
